## [0.0.2] – 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Calendar tab** – New sidebar tab to view tasks by date. Month grid with navigation, task indicators on dates, and task list for the selected day (defaults to today).
- **Project-colored mesh background** – Project detail screens use a custom mesh background tinted with the project’s color (`ProjectMeshBackgroundView`).
- **Search tasks** – Toolbar search field filters tasks by title, description, or project name on Pending, Today, and Completed tabs. Clear button when search has text.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**
  - **⌘K** – Focus search field
  - **⌘N** – New task (open New Task modal)
  - **⌘⇧N** – New project (open New Project modal from any tab)

### Changed

- **Task detail panel layout** – Task detail panel now overlays on the right instead of resizing the main content. Same behavior on Pending, Today, Completed, Calendar, and project detail views.
- **New Project modal** – Lifted to ContentView so it can be opened globally (e.g. via ⌘⇧N) and still works from the Projects tab.
